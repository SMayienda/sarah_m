        "## Objectives\n",

        "- Practice opening and inspecting the contents of CSVs using pandas dataframes\n",
        "- Practice identifying and handling missing values\n",
        "- Practice identifying and handling invalid values\n",
        "- Practice cleaning text data by removing whitespace and fixing typos\n",

        "In this lab, we'll work with a version of the comprehensive Superheroes Dataset, which can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/claudiodavi/superhero-set/data) and was originally scraped from [SuperHeroDb](https://www.superherodb.com/). We have modified the structure and contents of the dataset somewhat for the purposes of this lab.  Note that this data was collected in June 2017, so it may not reflect the most up-to-date superhero lore.\n",
        "\n",
        "The data is contained in two separate CSV files:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. `heroes_information.csv`: each record represents a superhero, with attributes of that superhero (e.g. eye color). Height is measured in centimeters, and weight is measured in pounds.\n",
        "2. `super_hero_powers.csv`: each record represents a superpower, then has True/False values representing whether each superhero has that power\n",
        "\n",
        "### Business Understanding\n",
        "\n",
        "The business questions you have been provided are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is the distribution of superheroes by publisher?\n",
        "2. What is the relationship between height and number of superpowers? And does this differ based on gender?\n",
        "3. What are the 5 most common superpowers in Marvel Comics vs. DC Comics?\n",

        "\n",
        "So, in addition to completing the basic data cleaning tasks and the aggregation and reshaping tasks needed to answer the provided questions, you will also need to formulate a question of your own and perform any additional cleaning/aggregation/reshaping that is needed to answer it."
